# Binary Tree Diameter

## Prompt

Write a function that takes in a Binary Tree and returns its diameter. The diameter of a binary tree is defined as the length of its longest path, even if that path doesn't pass through the root of the tree.

A path is a collection of connected nodes in a tree, where no node is connected to more than two other nodes. The length of a path is the number of edges between the path's first node and its last node.

Each **BinaryTree** node has an integer **value**, a **left** child node, and a **right** child node.

Children nodes can either be **BinaryTree** nodes themselves or **None**/ **null**.
