# Nth Fibonacci

The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:
the first number of the sequence is 0, the second number is 1, and the nth number is the sum of the (n -1)th and (n - 2)th numbers.

Write a function that takes in an integer n and returns the nth Fibonacci number.

Important note: the Fibonacci sequence is often defined with its first two numbers as F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1. For the purpose of this question, the first Fibonacci number is F(0); therefore, getNthFib(1) is equal to F(0), getNthFib(2) is equal to F(1), etc...

## Sample Output

```javascript
5; // 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5
```

## Solution #1
