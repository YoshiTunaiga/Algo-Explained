# Algo-Explained

Here you will be able to find some of the Coding Questions from AlgoExpert that I have taken and solved. I'll be explaining the approach I took to solve them.
As I go from Easy to Hard questions, be welcome to provide other type of ways to approach them, if possible.

These solved questions were for the purpose of gaining more knowledge on problem solving, as well as understanding the patterns that are there for developers to see but not easy to grasp.

Let's see how far can we go...

## UPDATES

After I started completing AlgoExpert problems, I found similar ones in LeetCode and decided to add them all in one big repo, while combining the ones I consider have the same structure.

These solved problems will now be coming in from:

- AlgoExpert
- [LeetCode](https://github.com/YoshiTunaiga/Algo-Explained/blob/master/LeetCode)
- [Grokking Design Patterns](https://github.com/YoshiTunaiga/Algo-Explained/blob/958dcbe6bb6f33cb5c2822fefedf433e55fc4469/GrokkingDesignPatterns)
- CodeWars
